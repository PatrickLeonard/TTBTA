## Synopsis

Terrible Turn-Based Tower Ascension v.6 -- A non-graphical turn-based combat dungeon crawler. Something "Rogue"-like, but without a graphical interface. This is a console only game. Get out your paper and pencil and start drawing your own map if you want to get to the top.

## Motivation

Fun way to learn about Java and it was also the subject of a college class for using Java to learn object oriented programming concepts. This program was for a second-year course in computer programming and object oriented programmming. 

## Installation

Compile using your favorite Java Compiler and then run the Main.class. Make sure to include the map.mp file and enough room to save your character's .DAT file.
